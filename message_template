Hi {fname},

My name is Koby Beard and I am a third year Computer Science major at Georgia Tech. I recently applied for the {finternship} internship position at {fcompany}. I saw on LinkedIn that youâ€™re a full time {fposition}. I was wondering if you have time for a quick phone call in the next week to discuss your work at {fcompany}? I would be very excited to learn more about your job. I have attached my resume below for reference. Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to hearing from you.

Best,
Koby Beard
